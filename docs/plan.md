# Feature roadmap

Mulch is a local-first browser instrument for turning samples into evolving loop performances.
Audio stays on the device. A performance stays editable, portable, reproducible through commands,
and identical through the live and offline signal paths.

The instrument today is an any-number-of-decks instrument, with decks the interface calls yards, a
durable session, portable archives, bounded undo/redo, and a menubar shell over a scrolled
instrument. A yard holds a source, a beat-aware loop with its own handles, a rack of effect
instances, a jump module, and a moiré drift picture of everything automating it. The source is
imported in any format the browser decodes or drawn from the generator list, both behind the one
source control in the yard's header. The picture is drawn over a reference row cut by the clip's own
analysis, it is anchored where in the source the yard is reading, it breathes with what the meters
read, and it opens large in a browser window of its own.
Every continuous parameter except the read rate carries a gesture-relative lane. Audio leaves
through one render harness: the File dialog writes a folder holding the .wav and the session that
made it, or a crop, or a flatten. A ⌘/Ctrl+K palette sends the same commands the screen sends.

Each of those is one decision record in [`docs/decisions`](decisions/), which says what it is and
why it is that way. This document holds only the path forward.

The product outcome guiding the next sequence is:

> A person can shape local samples into a beat-aware performance, recall its sounds and gestures
> exactly, and control it from either the screen or hardware without changing the instrument's
> underlying command model.

## 1. Ordered next work

Finish one step, including its full gate, before starting the next. A step delivers a usable
vertical slice, not infrastructure for a feature nobody has asked for.

An entry says what durable shape it moves before the step is started. That is what makes a step
expensive, so it is the first thing to state. A step is written against §2, §3, and the standing
clauses in [subagent-prompt.md](subagent-prompt.md).

No step is scheduled. The next one comes from [`ideas.md`](ideas.md) or from something the
instrument has not been asked for yet.

### What a step costs

- A new browser scenario lands on the gate one for one (§3). Assert in a scenario that already
  exists wherever one will hold it.
- Nothing gets a migration while pre-release
  ([0026](decisions/0026-pre-release-has-no-migrations.md)).
- A new jumps knob costs four things: a bound, a fineness and a curve in `src/lib/playerKnobs.ts`;
  a caption and a sentence in `src/lib/copyKnobs.ts`, which `src/ui/tooltips.test.ts` totals
  against `PLAYER_KNOBS` so a missing one fails the gate; and a written answer to whether any
  character region names it, in `src/lib/playerCharacter.ts`. A knob no region names stands where
  the switch left it. That is a good answer, and it has to be a written one
  ([0152](decisions/0152-a-character-is-a-region-of-the-spec.md)).
- Three files sit at the 800-line hard cap: `src/lib/player.ts` two under it, `src/lib/copy.ts` at
  797, and `src/lib/player.test.ts` at 796 — the kept ground's own validator cases went to
  `src/lib/playerBed.test.ts` beside `bedsOf` rather than in there (0194). Make room before landing
  at a cap, not after: the drop family moved out to `src/lib/playerDrop.ts` to make the room 0194
  needed.
- Transport test cases go in `src/audio/playerLanding.test.ts`, since `createDeckVoice` may only be
  stood up in a test file
  ([0045](decisions/0045-the-hard-cap-is-enforced-where-no-waiver-reaches.md), `scripts/arch`).
- Room in `src/lib/player.ts` is made by moving one family out to a file beside what reads it, the
  way `playerRest.ts`, `playerReverse.ts`, `playerSlots.ts`, `playerSpark.ts`, `playerClock.ts`,
  `playerRungs.ts`, `playerRepeats.ts` and `playerCharacter.ts` each took one. The file keeps the
  spec and the one validator.

## 2. Rules for every feature

- `src/app` remains the only writer of session state. UI, workers, keyboard, and agent JSONL call
  `send()` with serialisable commands.
- Scheduling stays on `Envelope.at`. Command shapes do not grow independent time fields.
- Parameter facts derive from the parameter and effect registries. A new parameter is declared once
  and bound once, and a value lookup is (instance, param)
  ([0030](decisions/0030-effects-are-instances.md)).
- Raw files, audio nodes, functions, and browser permission objects never enter commands or the
  durable session.
- `buildDeckChain(BaseAudioContext)` remains the one production signal path for live, headless,
  offline, fingerprint, and export hosts.
- Durable edits participate in bounded history, persistence, portable archives, and graph restore
  unless a decision proves why they do not.
- Per-frame playheads, meters, cursors, and gesture drafts use refs and the existing frame loop,
  never React state or another RAF loop.
- Async work carries source or operation identity, so a stale completion cannot overwrite newer
  state.
- Analysis is not a pure function of stored bytes: `decodeAudioData` may resample to the device's
  rate, so onsets differ across machines. Nothing durable may rest on derived analysis.
- A view preference, such as snap, theme, or whether the debug console is open, is not session
  state: no command, nothing durable, no history entry.
- Durable shape changes freely while pre-release. Stored data that no longer validates is
  discarded, never migrated ([0026](decisions/0026-pre-release-has-no-migrations.md)).
- No new dependency is added without approval and a statement of what it replaces.

## 3. Proof and delivery

`./scripts/check` is the full gate. It may get slower as the instrument gets bigger, but no single
feature may move its mean by more than 250ms without asking the human first
([0012](decisions/0012-no-one-feature-jumps-the-gate.md)). Each feature adds the cheapest proof at
the layer that owns the behavior:

- pure normalization, analysis, and DSP assertions in colocated Vitest tests;
- command, event, history, and failure atomicity through `createInstrument` and its manual clock;
- graph scheduling and sound through the existing live and offline browser run;
- UI focus, pointer, and file handling in the existing preview smoke;
- export parity by comparing every encoded sample with the shared graph buffer.

One fact has one emitter. `probe()` reports durable and session state, the event log reports
discrete behavior, and `peek()` and `peaks()` stay allocation-free continuous and sample-derived
reads. A UI ring drop is loud. A sequence gap in `./scripts/drive` is always a bug.

**The gate's headroom is not where it looks, and 0012's line applies to about one step.**
`./scripts/check` runs eleven steps concurrently and its wall clock is one of them. Measured over 35
runs at `88173b2`, `drive` costs 7425ms of a 7471ms mean, and the second-slowest step, `test`,
finishes 4747ms earlier. Everything that is not a browser scenario therefore has about 4.7s of slack
before it moves the gate at all, so a feature may add two seconds of Vitest and cost nothing. A
browser scenario's cost lands on the mean one for one. Inside `drive` the chain is `vite build`
(465ms, serial) then the 41 scenarios of `scripts/smoke.d/browser.js`, driven in order on one page
(5967ms). The six parallel `./scripts/drive` subprocesses beside it are free, the slowest finishing
3.5s early.

Measure a change by stashing it and comparing means across several runs, **interleaved**. A single
run's spread is wider than most features cost, one lucky measurement has already produced a wrong
figure twice, and fourteen pristine runs of one unchanged commit, split into two windows fifteen
minutes apart, read 7506ms and 7920ms. That is a 414ms drift, 1.7 times 0012's own step size. Never
quote a mean measured in a different window from the one it is compared against.

The smoke was long thought to sit near a non-linear cliff, where browser work added _before_
`persistenceSmoke`'s `page.reload()` stalled the reloaded page's audio clock. It did not reproduce
at `88173b2`, at 4 times the threshold that was supposed to stall nearly always. The ordering rule
below is kept for a stall nobody can currently find, and the mechanism still needs Chromium-side
tracing.

A popover the driver clicks through is the other measured trap. Playwright waits out a popup's enter
and exit animations before it may click, which cost one scenario about 450ms after the reload and
1.68s before it. A popup whose entries `./scripts/drive` presses opens instantly
([0056](decisions/0056-an-effect-carries-its-own-icon.md)).

Offline `render()` calls are the cheap place to prove sound. They join underneath the deck fixture's
real-time waits and cost close to nothing. New browser work that cannot be a render belongs after
the reload, or on its own page, not on the pre-reload critical path.

When a feature changes a data boundary, graph lifecycle, or ownership rule, write the decision and a
failing seam-level test before broad UI work. Do not turn the driver into a second application by
teaching it feature semantics.

A step run by a subagent gets the standing clauses in
[subagent-prompt.md](subagent-prompt.md): report to a path, watch the test fail, print no new
warnings, waive at the site, four review lenses, interleave base and head. Each is there because a
run paid for its absence, and the cost is named beside it. Paste them. A paraphrase drops the
sentence that made the clause work.
