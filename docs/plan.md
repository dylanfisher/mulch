# Feature roadmap

Mulch is a local-first browser instrument for turning samples into evolving loop performances.
Audio stays on the device. A performance stays editable, portable, reproducible through commands,
and identical through the live and offline signal paths.

## 1. Ordered next work

Finish one step, including its full gate, before starting the next. A step delivers a usable
vertical slice, not infrastructure for a feature nobody has asked for.

An entry says what durable shape it moves before the step is started. That is what makes a step
expensive, so it is the first thing to state. A step is written against §2, §3, and the standing
clauses in [subagent-prompt.md](subagent-prompt.md).

A block that adds N of one thing — a look per effect, a sketch per question, a worklet per entry —
names the file layout before its first step: one file per thing from the first, with its `@role`
line and its map.md row, rather than one file that hits the 800-line cap and pays a split on four
consecutive steps.

_No steps scheduled. The next block goes here, in its decided order, written against §2 and §3._

## 2. Rules for every feature

- `src/app` remains the only writer of session state. UI, workers, keyboard, and agent JSONL call
  `send()` with serialisable commands.
- Scheduling stays on `Envelope.at`. Command shapes do not grow independent time fields.
- Parameter facts derive from the parameter and effect registries. A new parameter is declared once
  and bound once, and a value lookup is (instance, param)
  ([0030](decisions/0030-effects-are-instances.md)).
- Raw files, audio nodes, functions, and browser permission objects never enter commands or the
  durable session.
- `buildDeckChain(BaseAudioContext)` remains the one production signal path for live, headless,
  offline, fingerprint, and export hosts.
- Durable edits participate in bounded history, persistence, portable archives, and graph restore
  unless a decision proves why they do not.
- Per-frame playheads, meters, cursors, and gesture drafts use refs and the existing frame loop,
  never React state or another RAF loop.
- Async work carries source or operation identity, so a stale completion cannot overwrite newer
  state.
- Analysis is not a pure function of stored bytes: `decodeAudioData` may resample to the device's
  rate, so onsets differ across machines. Nothing durable may rest on derived analysis.
- A view preference, such as snap, theme, or whether the debug console is open, is not session
  state: no command, nothing durable, no history entry.
- Durable shape changes freely while pre-release. Stored data that no longer validates is
  discarded, never migrated ([0026](decisions/0026-pre-release-has-no-migrations.md)).
- No new dependency is added without approval and a statement of what it replaces.

## 3. Proof and delivery

`./scripts/check` is the full gate. It may get slower as the instrument gets bigger, but no single
feature may move its mean by more than 250ms without asking the human first
([0012](decisions/0012-no-one-feature-jumps-the-gate.md)). Each feature adds the cheapest proof at
the layer that owns the behavior:

- pure normalization, analysis, and DSP assertions in colocated Vitest tests;
- command, event, history, and failure atomicity through `createInstrument` and its manual clock;
- graph scheduling and sound through the existing live and offline browser run;
- UI focus, pointer, and file handling in the existing preview smoke;
- export parity by comparing every encoded sample with the shared graph buffer.

One fact has one emitter. `probe()` reports durable and session state, the event log reports
discrete behavior, and `peek()` and `peaks()` stay allocation-free continuous and sample-derived
reads. A UI ring drop is loud. A sequence gap in `./scripts/drive` is always a bug.

**The gate's headroom is not where it looks, and 0012's line applies to about one step.**
`./scripts/check` runs eleven steps concurrently and its wall clock is one of them. Measured over 35
runs at `88173b2`, `drive` costs 7425ms of a 7471ms mean, and the second-slowest step, `test`,
finishes 4747ms earlier. Everything that is not a browser scenario therefore has about 4.7s of slack
before it moves the gate at all, so a feature may add two seconds of Vitest and cost nothing. A
browser scenario's cost lands on the mean one for one. Inside `drive` the chain is `vite build`
(465ms, serial) then the 41 scenarios of `scripts/smoke.d/browser.js`, driven in order on one page
(5967ms). The six parallel `./scripts/drive` subprocesses beside it are free, the slowest finishing
3.5s early.

Measure a change by stashing it and comparing means across several runs, **interleaved**. A single
run's spread is wider than most features cost, one lucky measurement has already produced a wrong
figure twice, and fourteen pristine runs of one unchanged commit, split into two windows fifteen
minutes apart, read 7506ms and 7920ms. That is a 414ms drift, 1.7 times 0012's own step size. Never
quote a mean measured in a different window from the one it is compared against.

The smoke was long thought to sit near a non-linear cliff, where browser work added _before_
`persistenceSmoke`'s `page.reload()` stalled the reloaded page's audio clock. It did not reproduce
at `88173b2`, at 4 times the threshold that was supposed to stall nearly always. The ordering rule
below is kept for a stall nobody can currently find, and the mechanism still needs Chromium-side
tracing.

A popover the driver clicks through is the other measured trap. Playwright waits out a popup's enter
and exit animations before it may click, which cost one scenario about 450ms after the reload and
1.68s before it. A popup whose entries `./scripts/drive` presses opens instantly
([0056](decisions/0056-an-effect-carries-its-own-icon.md)).

Offline `render()` calls are the cheap place to prove sound. They join underneath the deck fixture's
real-time waits and cost close to nothing. New browser work that cannot be a render picks one of the
browser half's three lanes and states what that lane's page must already hold in its prelude, rather
than reading what a neighbouring scenario happened to leave
([0238](decisions/0238-the-browser-smoke-runs-in-lanes.md)). The reload ordering rule above is a rule
about the chain lane, which is the only one that reloads.

When a feature changes a data boundary, graph lifecycle, or ownership rule, write the decision and a
failing seam-level test before broad UI work. Do not turn the driver into a second application by
teaching it feature semantics.

A step run by a subagent gets the standing clauses in
[subagent-prompt.md](subagent-prompt.md): report to a path, watch the test fail, print no new
warnings, waive at the site, four review lenses, interleave base and head. Each is there because a
run paid for its absence, and the cost is named beside it. Paste them. A paraphrase drops the
sentence that made the clause work.

## 4. Not taken

Everything abandoned, narrowed, or landed with a known cost, one paragraph each. Nothing here is
scheduled by being here.
